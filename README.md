## Description

In this project, I built a bash command line tool that return the art period (e.g. Renaissance) when a specific year is given. I pushed it to Dockerhub and tested through AWS Cloud9.

We will receive the message "Let's know about the history of art! Enter the year you are interested in." For example, when entering the year 1550, it will return "Renaissance".
